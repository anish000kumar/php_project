# php_project
Standard file-system configured for creating a new php project.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Once cloned, you will obtain a file structure :-
-app
-classes
-views
-resources
    -css
    -js
    -img
    -Twig
    -cache


So, it helps you in getting started with a fresh php project, which would be making use of bootstrap css, font-awesome icons, and Twig templating engine by default. All you need to do is clone it up and all of these integrations would be done in a snap.

Use this command to clone it on your local machine-

$ git clone http://github.com/anish000kumar/php_project <DESIRED NAME OF YOUR FOLDER>
